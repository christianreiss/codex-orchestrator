- Rebuilt the Quota Policy card into an Operations & Settings panel that now hosts the quota toggle, API kill switch, runner trigger, seed auth.json action, and version check instead of scattering those controls across the header; the entire panel is collapsible (hidden by default) to keep the dashboard compact.
- Moved the insecure-host enable window slider into the same Operations & Settings panel, persist the selection locally (2–60 minutes), and pass it along whenever an insecure host is re-enabled.
- Expanded the AGENTS.md editor modal with a wider layout and taller textarea so editing lengthy instructions isn’t cramped.
- Removed the AGENTS.md SHA display from the dashboard meta line to keep that info box focused on update time and size.
- Admins can now pick a 2–60 minute insecure-host window via the dashboard slider; `/admin/hosts/{id}/insecure/enable` accepts `duration_minutes`, the server persists `insecure_window_minutes`, `/auth` extends windows by that duration (default 10), and docs/UI/CHANGELOG were updated accordingly.
- Added canonical AGENTS.md storage on the server with `/agents/retrieve` for hosts and `/admin/agents` (+ dashboard modal) for admins; hosts replace `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` on every sync and delete stale copies when the server copy is cleared.
- Dashboard now shows an AGENTS.md panel with inline preview + edit modal so project instructions can be updated without shell access.
- cdx pulls AGENTS.md alongside slash commands (python required), handles offline/missing-config gracefully, and surfaces sync status in the boot summary; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.05-01.
- Updated source-of-truth docs (API/DB/cdx) and README to reflect server-managed AGENTS.md instead of the old manual sync script.

# 2025-12-04
- Reformatted ChatGPT quota reset labels to read naturally (e.g., “Resets in 5 days (Tuesday)” and richer sub-48h phrasing) instead of the old “5d 13h 54m to reset” timer text.
- Added `scripts/sync-agents.php` to sync the repo’s `AGENTS.md` into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (honors `CODEX_HOME`) so Codex always picks up the latest project instructions with a single command.
- Rebuilt the ChatGPT Estimated Total cost modal with hoverable tooltips, a detailed per-day panel, and a scrolling day-by-day table so you can see exact dates and values instead of guessing from the old coarse chart.
- Added a Slash Commands “New Command” button that opens the creation modal empty, so fresh prompts can be authored without editing an existing entry first.

# 2025-12-02
- Applied the grok.com neon black theme across the admin dashboard + Client Logs views (desktop + mobile) so both screens match the new Grok-branded look-and-feel.
- Rebuilt the Grok theme using the `/root/grok.html` charcoal + teal palette so every dashboard/logs surface (backgrounds, nav, cards, chips, logs, toggles, mobile) now matches grok.com with zero neon gradients left.
- Iterated on the admin styling twice: first with a charcoal/blue corporate pass, then all the way to a light, airy OpenAI-inspired look (white cards, soft shadows, subtle accents) and restored the OpenAI logo in both dashboard + logs headers, keeping desktop/mobile in sync.
- Reshaped the ChatGPT usage summary so the Input/Output/Cached cards mirror the Estimated Total box and now show Today/Week/Month token counts (no more per-card cost rows or USD heading).
- Estimated Total now reports actual ChatGPT costs (using pricing_day/week/month_cost + currency) with Today/Week/Month cost chips instead of duplicating token counts.
- Simplified the Authorized Hosts table headers so the sort controls look like standard clickable text (no chunky buttons) for easier scanning.
- Converted the Authorized Hosts column sorters to plain text links (with keyboard support) so the remaining “button bubble” chrome is gone across browsers.
- Updated table hover highlights to a light orange accent so row selection/hover states match the airy theme instead of the previous dark blue wash.
- Restyled the Authorized Hosts table to stick with the green accent palette (header gradient + green row fills/hover states) so the list feels cohesive with the rest of the admin look.
- Swapped all button hover states (nav + standard + “ghost” controls such as Logs/Seed/New Host) to the green accent gradient so the old blue dip is gone.
- Tweaked the cdx CLI (bin + seeded wrapper) so insecure hosts treat expected auth refreshes as normal: no more “updating auth / auth outdated” noise in the command/result/auth rows, and the auth status tone stays green unless there’s a real problem.
- Added dedicated launcher commands: `cdx shell` now forces `--model gpt-5.1-codex` and `cdx code` forces `--model gpt-5.1-codex-max` before calling Codex, and `cdx --execute "<prompt>"` runs `codex --model gpt-5.1 --sandbox read-only -a untrusted exec --skip-git-repo-check` directly (no wrapper output) while passing through extra arguments, capturing the final reply via `--output-last-message` and printing only that reply; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.02-04.
- Boot summary rows are now deduplicated, sorted, and easier to read while keeping the quota bars untouched.
- Fixed `cdx --execute` so `--skip-git-repo-check` is passed after `exec`, matching Codex CLI expectations.
- Fixed cdx runner telemetry so the status line reflects the fresh verification time immediately after the runner is triggered.
- cdx now shows “auth runner just verified” when the runner completed within ~90 seconds, replacing “<1m ago”; wrapper version bumped to 2025.12.02-01.

# 2025-12-01
- Estimated Total card no longer repeats the month-to-date total in its header, relying on the breakdown chips below.
- cdx now treats `/auth` HTTP 5xx/network outages as offline, keeping cached auth usable and surfacing the offline reason instead of hard failures.
- Slash command sync reports API outages/HTTP 5xx as offline (warn) and the wrapper version is bumped to 2025.12.01-03.
- Token usage ingests now compute and persist per-entry/aggregate costs from configured pricing (with backfill for existing rows) and expose a Cost column + currency on the Client Logs page.
- Auth runner preflight now runs every ~8 hours (first non-admin request per window) instead of once per UTC day, still refreshing the cached GitHub client version; interval configurable via `AUTH_RUNNER_PREFLIGHT_SECONDS` (default 28800s).
- Restyled the ChatGPT month-to-date cost cards with balanced tokens/cost lines and a dedicated total header, replacing the squished four-box layout.
- Estimated Total graph now opens a dedicated 60-day cost trend (input/output/cached) instead of reusing the quota chart placeholder.
- Added a stats icon to the ChatGPT estimated total card to mirror the weekly limit affordance.
- ChatGPT estimated total icon now opens the quota trend chart, matching the weekly limit graph control.
- Authorized Hosts table headers are now clickable to sort (toggle ascending/descending) by host, last seen, client, wrapper, or IP.
- Refreshed the ChatGPT estimated total card with a highlighted primary figure and chips for Today/Week/Month breakdown.
- Admin overview now includes daily token/cost totals for the dashboard, and the ChatGPT cost card shows Today/Week/Month estimates without the previous “includes” blurb.
- Added bash 4.2-safe guard for wrapper release tag selection to prevent `candidate_tags[@]` nounset errors during Codex refresh, and bumped wrapper version to 2025.12.01-02.
- Installer now selects the extracted Codex binary (skipping the tarball) and tolerates empty user lists on bash 4.2 by guarding array expansion in cdx, preventing nounset crashes during install/version checks.
- Fixed installer curl invocation to avoid `curl_flags[@]` unbound variable errors on older bash releases (e.g., CloudLinux 7) when IPv4 forcing is unset.
- Fixed installation UUID bootstrap to reuse existing `.env` values and avoid chmods that broke web-user access, preventing API 500s when env files were unreadable.
- Added installation UUID enforcement (server + baked cdx) to prevent cross-instance mixups; `/auth` rejects mismatched `installation_id`, installers/cdx carry the UUID.
- Added persistent IPv4-only host toggle (admin API + dashboard) that clears IP binding and bakes wrappers/installers with `curl -4`; cdx fetches updates over IPv4 when set.
- Aligned Logs header button styling with other admin controls.
- Installation UUID now auto-generates at boot/migration via shared helper, ensuring `.env` is populated across entrypoints without manual edits.
- Dashboard now shows weekly and month-to-date cost estimates side-by-side (using pricing + token usage) instead of daily totals.
- ChatGPT usage cost card now renders separate lines: “X$ this Week” and “Y$ this Month” for clearer readability.
- Weekly cost now uses the ChatGPT weekly limit window start (when available) instead of a naive trailing 7-day slice for more accurate estimates.
