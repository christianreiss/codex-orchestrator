# 2025-12-01
- Added a stats icon to the ChatGPT estimated total card to mirror the weekly limit affordance.
- ChatGPT estimated total icon now opens the quota trend chart, matching the weekly limit graph control.
- Refreshed the ChatGPT estimated total card with a highlighted primary figure and chips for Today/Week/Month breakdown.
- Admin overview now includes daily token/cost totals for the dashboard, and the ChatGPT cost card shows Today/Week/Month estimates without the previous “includes” blurb.
- Added bash 4.2-safe guard for wrapper release tag selection to prevent `candidate_tags[@]` nounset errors during Codex refresh, and bumped wrapper version to 2025.12.01-02.
- Installer now selects the extracted Codex binary (skipping the tarball) and tolerates empty user lists on bash 4.2 by guarding array expansion in cdx, preventing nounset crashes during install/version checks.
- Fixed installer curl invocation to avoid `curl_flags[@]` unbound variable errors on older bash releases (e.g., CloudLinux 7) when IPv4 forcing is unset.
- Fixed installation UUID bootstrap to reuse existing `.env` values and avoid chmods that broke web-user access, preventing API 500s when env files were unreadable.
- Added installation UUID enforcement (server + baked cdx) to prevent cross-instance mixups; `/auth` rejects mismatched `installation_id`, installers/cdx carry the UUID.
- Added persistent IPv4-only host toggle (admin API + dashboard) that clears IP binding and bakes wrappers/installers with `curl -4`; cdx fetches updates over IPv4 when set.
- Aligned Logs header button styling with other admin controls.
- Installation UUID now auto-generates at boot/migration via shared helper, ensuring `.env` is populated across entrypoints without manual edits.
- Dashboard now shows weekly and month-to-date cost estimates side-by-side (using pricing + token usage) instead of daily totals.
- ChatGPT usage cost card now renders separate lines: “X$ this Week” and “Y$ this Month” for clearer readability.
- Weekly cost now uses the ChatGPT weekly limit window start (when available) instead of a naive trailing 7-day slice for more accurate estimates.
