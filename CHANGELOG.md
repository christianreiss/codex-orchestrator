- Added `cdx --execute "<prompt>"` to run `codex --model gpt-5.1 --skip-git-repo-check exec` directly (no wrapper output) while passing through extra arguments; wrapper version bumped to 2025.12.02-02.
- Fixed cdx runner telemetry so the status line reflects the fresh verification time immediately after the runner is triggered.
- cdx now shows “auth runner just verified” when the runner completed within ~90 seconds, replacing “<1m ago”; wrapper version bumped to 2025.12.02-01.

- Estimated Total card no longer repeats the month-to-date total in its header, relying on the breakdown chips below.
- cdx now treats `/auth` HTTP 5xx/network outages as offline, keeping cached auth usable and surfacing the offline reason instead of hard failures.
- Slash command sync reports API outages/HTTP 5xx as offline (warn) and the wrapper version is bumped to 2025.12.01-03.
- Token usage ingests now compute and persist per-entry/aggregate costs from configured pricing (with backfill for existing rows) and expose a Cost column + currency on the Client Logs page.
- Auth runner preflight now runs every ~8 hours (first non-admin request per window) instead of once per UTC day, still refreshing the cached GitHub client version; interval configurable via `AUTH_RUNNER_PREFLIGHT_SECONDS` (default 28800s).
- Restyled the ChatGPT month-to-date cost cards with balanced tokens/cost lines and a dedicated total header, replacing the squished four-box layout.
- Estimated Total graph now opens a dedicated 60-day cost trend (input/output/cached) instead of reusing the quota chart placeholder.
- Added a stats icon to the ChatGPT estimated total card to mirror the weekly limit affordance.
- ChatGPT estimated total icon now opens the quota trend chart, matching the weekly limit graph control.
- Authorized Hosts table headers are now clickable to sort (toggle ascending/descending) by host, last seen, client, wrapper, or IP.
- Refreshed the ChatGPT estimated total card with a highlighted primary figure and chips for Today/Week/Month breakdown.
- Admin overview now includes daily token/cost totals for the dashboard, and the ChatGPT cost card shows Today/Week/Month estimates without the previous “includes” blurb.
- Added bash 4.2-safe guard for wrapper release tag selection to prevent `candidate_tags[@]` nounset errors during Codex refresh, and bumped wrapper version to 2025.12.01-02.
- Installer now selects the extracted Codex binary (skipping the tarball) and tolerates empty user lists on bash 4.2 by guarding array expansion in cdx, preventing nounset crashes during install/version checks.
- Fixed installer curl invocation to avoid `curl_flags[@]` unbound variable errors on older bash releases (e.g., CloudLinux 7) when IPv4 forcing is unset.
- Fixed installation UUID bootstrap to reuse existing `.env` values and avoid chmods that broke web-user access, preventing API 500s when env files were unreadable.
- Added installation UUID enforcement (server + baked cdx) to prevent cross-instance mixups; `/auth` rejects mismatched `installation_id`, installers/cdx carry the UUID.
- Added persistent IPv4-only host toggle (admin API + dashboard) that clears IP binding and bakes wrappers/installers with `curl -4`; cdx fetches updates over IPv4 when set.
- Aligned Logs header button styling with other admin controls.
- Installation UUID now auto-generates at boot/migration via shared helper, ensuring `.env` is populated across entrypoints without manual edits.
- Dashboard now shows weekly and month-to-date cost estimates side-by-side (using pricing + token usage) instead of daily totals.
- ChatGPT usage cost card now renders separate lines: “X$ this Week” and “Y$ this Month” for clearer readability.
- Weekly cost now uses the ChatGPT weekly limit window start (when available) instead of a naive trailing 7-day slice for more accurate estimates.
