- Admin config builder: added background terminal experimental feature toggle; cache-bumped config.js v=2025-12-25-03.
- Admin hosts: pruning indicator now honors Settings → General inactivity window (0 disables) instead of hard-coded 30 days; cache-bumped dashboard.js v=2025-12-25-02.
- Admin config builder: added switches for Codex 0.77 experimental feature flags (unified exec, RMCP OAuth, sandbox assessment, ghost commit, Windows sandbox); cache-bumped config.js v=2025-12-25-01.
- Admin config builder/profiles/host overrides: add `gpt-5.2-codex` as a selectable model with low/medium/high/xhigh reasoning; server now forces reasoning summaries to `detailed` for that series just like other codex-specific models.
- cdx wrapper: detect Codex versions that lack `--reasoning-effort`, skip passing the flag, and emit a warning instead of failing the launch; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.19-01.
- cdx wrapper: remove the duplicate insecure-host bootstrap warning and collapse the insecure-host result summary to "Codex to brrrr (insecure host)"; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.18-06.
- cdx wrapper: preserve argv across wrapper self-update restart so `cdx resume` (and other non-flag first args) survive the re-exec; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.18-05.
- Installer: choose the musl (static) Codex release asset on older glibc (<2.39) so CentOS 7 / Debian 11-class hosts don’t require `libssl.so.3`.
- Admin hosts/installer: “Allow insecure curl (-k)” now persists as a per-host `curl_insecure` flag and bakes `CODEX_SYNC_ALLOW_INSECURE=1` into the `cdx` wrapper (disables TLS verification for sync when you intentionally run self-signed); installer still bakes `CODEX_INSTALL_CURL_INSECURE=1` into the piped `bash` so wrapper + Codex downloads reuse `curl -k`; cache-bumped dashboard.js v=2025-12-18-02.
- Installer: use `cdx --wrapper-version` during install so it doesn’t run a full sync/codex launch (avoids surprising SSL failures during bootstrap).
- cdx wrapper: guard the Usage summary `token_bits` join so runs under `set -u` don’t crash with `token_bits[@]` unbound (affects hosts before the first token usage sync), fix baked-placeholder sentinels so per-host overrides (`model_override`, `reasoning_effort_override`, `force_ipv4`, `secure`, `installation_id`, `cdx_silent`) don’t get reset after baking, and allow wrapper self-update to pass `curl -k` when `CODEX_SYNC_ALLOW_INSECURE=1`; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.18-04.
- Admin settings: Skill modal now shows validation/saving status inline, so slug/manifest errors are visible instead of hiding underneath the Fleet Skill registry panel.
- Admin settings: Fix the Fleet Skill registry “New” button so it always opens the modal and surfaces an error when the manifest input is missing instead of silently doing nothing.
- Admin settings: Fleet Skill registry now lives under Settings → Skills (tab after Profiles); the standalone `#skills` hash redirects to `#settings/skills`, and dashboard.js is cache-bumped to v=2025-12-17-04.
- Skill system: new `/skills` endpoints + `skills` table mirror slash-command behaviors (list/retrieve/store/delete) with `SkillService`, admin dashboard gets a Skills tab + modal editor, `cdx` syncs `~/.codex/skills` (pull + push) with offline-safe baselines, docs/README updated, and wrapper bumped to 2025.12.17-01.
- Config builder: clamp `model_reasoning_summary` to `detailed` for `gpt-5.1-codex*` (OpenAI only accepts `reasoning.summary=detailed`); cache-bumped config.js v=2025-12-15-20.
- Admin hosts: added “Temporary host” provisioning (`POST /admin/hosts/register` body `temporary=true`) with a sliding 2-hour idle expiry (pruned 2h after the last successful host contact), backed by `hosts.expires_at` and `host.pruned` reason `expired`; cache-bumped dashboard.js v=2025-12-15-20.
- cdx wrapper: fixed token-usage parsing crashing on Python 3.9 (AlmaLinux 9) due to Python 3.10-only type hints (`str | None`); wrapper bumped to 2025.12.15-03.
- cdx wrapper: fixed `cdx --uninstall` failing (cmd_uninstall was invoked before the wrapper had defined its helpers); wrapper bumped to 2025.12.15-02.
- Installer: fixed insecure host registration emitting install tokens without an API key (which could 500 on `curl .../install/<token> | bash`).
- cdx wrapper: suppress duplicate boot summary/compat lines when the wrapper self-updates and re-execs (you now only get one header); wrapper bumped to 2025.12.15-01.
- Admin settings/memories: wired the delete action to the numeric memory `record_id` (UI buttons now work, show host/key metadata, and disable when missing), documented the admin delete endpoint/field, and cache-bumped dashboard.js v=2025-12-14-13 + dashboard.css v=2025-12-14-11.
- Admin settings/memories: fixed the Memories tab not rendering (bad JS wiring + missing DOM ref). Loader now targets the Settings → Memories panel, wires `memoriesTableWrap`, and host filter passes `host_id`; cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-14-12.
- Admin settings: fixed Settings → config.toml (and other settings tabs) sticking around when navigating back to the dashboard (HTML nesting bug: Settings panel-set was closed early).
- Admin settings/profiles: profile rows are now collapsed by default (click to expand) and the per-profile feature toggles render in a 2×2 grid; cache bump to dashboard.css/profiles.js v=2025-12-14-10.
- Admin dashboard: Validation Service card now shows the host that last wrote the current canonical auth.json (source FQDN + stored time); cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-14-07.
- cdx wrapper: boot summary now shows MCP status, shortens Runner to icon-only, and moves the week-partition indicator from Core → Quota day; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.14-03.
- Admin settings/hosts: Codex Version selectors now omit GitHub prereleases (alpha/beta) and only list full releases, while still including the currently targeted/pinned/in-use version for visibility; cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-14-04.
- Admin hosts: removed all row background coloring in the Authorized Hosts table (rows are now transparent; no secure/insecure/unprovisioned shading); cache bump to dashboard.css/dashboard-mobile.css v=2025-12-14-08.
- Profiles: added a Settings → Profiles tab to add/edit/delete `config.toml` profiles (model, reasoning effort, approval policy, sandbox mode, plus stream/search/image/network toggles). Config builder no longer embeds profile editing; per-profile TOML now includes nested `[profiles.<name>.features]` + `[profiles.<name>.sandbox_workspace_write]`. `cdx <profile>` is now shorthand for `--profile <profile>` when the profile exists; removed the old `cdx shell`/`cdx code` model presets; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.14-03; cache bump to dashboard.js/config.js/profiles.js v=2025-12-14-06.
- Admin hosts: added per-host Codex CLI version override (“Global” or pinned semver) that overrides the fleet policy; pinned hosts get `client_version_source=locked` so `cdx` enforces the exact version; cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-13-09.
- Admin settings: added a Codex version selector (Latest/recent releases) that can pin the fleet to a specific Codex release; when pinned (`client_version_source=locked`) the `cdx` wrapper enforces the exact target version (upgrade or downgrade); wrapper bumped to 2025.12.13-02; cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-13-08.
- Config builder: fixed `config.toml` generator settings “disappearing” when `client_config_documents` had non-canonical/legacy rows (prefer `id=1` when present, tolerate double-encoded JSON settings).
- Admin hosts: when a host is flagged “Outdated auth”, the “Can login” chip is now suppressed (no more contradictory status); cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-13-04.
- Admin access: fixed `requireAdminAccess()` enforcing `ADMIN_ACCESS_MODE=mtls` (removed stale `mtls_only` check) so `/admin/*` is denied when mTLS headers are missing.
- Admin hosts: hosts table row backgrounds now use a single neutral zebra stripe (removed status-based row gradients); cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-13-03.
- Config sync: `/config/retrieve` now applies per-host `model_override` + `reasoning_effort_override` to the baked `config.toml` (`model`, `model_reasoning_effort`) so `~/.codex/config.toml` matches the host’s effective defaults.
- Admin hosts: model/reasoning overrides now auto-save on select (no Save button) and are baked into the per-host `cdx` wrapper download; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.13-01; cache bump to dashboard.js v=2025-12-13-02.
- Admin hosts: fixed `/admin/#hosts` deep link scrolling the Authorized Hosts table to the top (hiding the All/Secure/Insecure tabs); cache bump to dashboard.css/dashboard.js v=2025-12-13-01.
- Admin dashboard: Estimated Total now auto-selects Plus/Pro from the ChatGPT usage stats; removed the manual plan toggle buttons; savings badge is now inline (“X% Saved!”).
- Admin hosts: fixed the Insecure Hosts “Toggler” enable button requiring two clicks by using the server-provided active flag for toggle state.
- Admin insecure-hosts “Toggler” modal: fixed enabled hosts showing “Online: expired” by returning timezone-aware `insecure_enabled_until` timestamps from `/admin/hosts/insecure`.
- Admin settings: fixed Canonical AGENTS.md panel leaking onto the Dashboard after navigating away from Settings → Agents (HTML nesting bug).
- Ops/debug: `public/mtls-debug.php` now returns 404 unless `CODEX_DEBUG=1`.
- Auth runner: probe now uses `-s read-only` and no longer bypasses approvals/sandbox.
- Repo: filled GPLv3 appendix placeholders in `LICENSE` with 2025 + Christian Reiss.
- Admin settings: configurable inactive-host pruning window (0–60 days) now overrides `INACTIVITY_WINDOW_DAYS`.
- Admin logs: Client Reports cost column now rounds to 2 decimals; cache bump to logs.js v=2025-12-12-04.
- Admin hosts: VIP indicator is now a plain 👑 (no badge/pill) in the Authorized Hosts list and host detail modal; cache bump to v=2025-12-12-03.
- Admin dashboard: added Plus/Pro plan pricing (`CHATGPT_PLUS_PLAN_COST`, `CHATGPT_PRO_PLAN_COST`) and color-coded monthly “Estimated Total” vs plan with a “% saved this month” badge.
- Admin access: removed `ADMIN_REQUIRE_MTLS`/`DASHBOARD_ADMIN_KEY` and standardized on `ADMIN_ACCESS_MODE=mtls|none`.
- Admin access: accept colon/dash formatted mTLS fingerprints from proxies (normalize to hex before validating).
- Admin config builder: fixed “Save & Deploy” HTTP 422 sha mismatch when saving immediately after edits (stale preview SHA); the save flow now uses the *saved* sha for optimistic concurrency (instead of the preview hash), and admin assets are cache-busted so browsers actually pick up the fix.
- Admin insecure-hosts “Toggler” modal now shows remaining online time under enabled host FQDNs.
- Removed admin passkey/WebAuthn system: deleted passkey endpoints, DB table, dashboard UI, and related dependencies. Admin access is now enforced via mTLS only (`ADMIN_ACCESS_MODE=mtls`).
- Config builder UI now shows the actual save error (HTTP status + validation details) instead of only “Save failed”.
- Settings consolidated into a single tabbed page (Settings/Agents/Slash commands/Memories/config) via embedded subpages; header menu now links directly to Settings. Cache bump to dashboard.css v=2025-12-08-22.
- Passkey enrollment/auth now accepts base64url (no more "invalid character" errors) and tolerates http/https origins for the resolved host; client `id` serialization aligns with rawId.
- Settings tabs now inline real content (Agents/Prompts/Memories) instead of iframes; config builder still uses config.js but lives in-page. Header menu still flat. Cache bump to dashboard.css v=2025-12-08-29.
- Added hero/info boxes to Hosts and Settings to match Logs (title + subtitle, no extra controls).
- Settings tabs wired with embed-aware nav (nav.js cache bump to v=2025-12-08-06) so each tab loads its page without showing nested headers.
- Dashboard hero/info box removed; tightened spacing between nav, menu, cards, quota section, hosts and logs bottom padding; cache bump to dashboard.css v=2025-12-08-21.
- Logs dropdown removed (plain link), added on-page tabs for Client vs MCP logs, and cache bumped to dashboard.css v=2025-12-08-17.
- Hosts UI merged into a single page with on-page tabs (All/Secure/Insecure/Unprovisioned), hosts menu entry is now a simple link (no dropdown), and assets cache-bumped to v=2025-12-08-16 / dashboard.js v=2025-12-08-06.
- Header nav simplified to plain text (no pills, no hover fill, no underline), dropdown kept minimal, and lower menu hidden; cache bump to v=2025-12-08-15.
- Admin nav underline forced neutral (no shadows/gradients) and cache bumped to v=2025-12-08-13 to squash lingering green glow on Hosts/Logs/Settings dropdown triggers.
- Admin nav dropdown triggers stripped to plain text (appearance reset, no background image/shadow/filter) with another cache bump to purge lingering green glow on Hosts/Logs/Settings.
- Admin nav pill styles fully removed (no hover background/green glow); dropdown links now sit above content and use underline-only active state.
- Admin nav bar restyled to a flat, square, underline-only look (no neon pills/shadows), with neutral dropdowns and a fresh CSS cache buster so the new styles load immediately.
- Admin nav bar flattened to plain text links with square hover dropdowns (no gradients/shadows, dropdowns sit flush under the trigger) so Hosts/Logs/Settings stop looking like glowing bubbles.
- Added dedicated admin pages for Hosts, Memories, Settings (alongside existing Agents/Prompts/Logs) so every menu item opens a real subpage instead of query-driven views.
- Dashboard cost cards moved out of the ChatGPT section: input/output/cached token totals and estimated total USD now show as top-level info boxes alongside Hosts/Versions/Tokens (with cost trend button).
- Admin dashboard hero is back (Dashboard · Fleet overview) with a square, flush menu bar (`Overview/Hosts/Logs/Agents/Slash commands/Memories/Settings`) wired to the existing `?view=` routes; active highlighting now covers the new tabs.
- Admin dashboard: split AGENTS.md and Slash Commands into dedicated pages (`/admin/agents.html` and `/admin/prompts.html`) instead of embedding them on the dashboard/hosts views; navigation links now point to the standalone editors.
- cdx quota summary now lists 5h, day, and week in that order (aligning with the daily allowance view) and bumps wrapper to 2025.12.08-01.
- Admin config builder: hide `codex-coordinator` from the “Configured MCP servers” list so only operator-added MCP servers are shown (managed entries remain injected per-host).
- cdx wrapper: when `[otel]` is present in `config.toml`, export `OTEL_*` env vars before launching `codex` so traces can be shipped via OTLP without per-host glue.
- Admin Agents: AGENTS.md now always renders the full file contents, and the Edit button opens a working editor modal (previously the modal markup was missing).
- Admin Agents: replaced the modal editor with inline click-to-edit and a dedicated Save button on `#settings/agents`.
- Admin hosts: add per-host `cdx` model + reasoning-effort overrides (defaults to the fleet-wide config when unset).

# 2025-12-07
- Added Quota Policy week partition (Off/7d/5d) that splits the weekly ChatGPT window into a daily allowance; `/admin/quota-mode` + `/auth` now carry `quota_week_partition`, dashboard gets a selector, and `cdx` shows a third quota bar that obeys warn/deny policy.
- Admin MCP access log table now shows UTC timestamps as `dd.mm.yyyy, hh:mm:ss`, resolves host IDs to FQDNs, and opens a detail modal when you click a row so you can inspect request/error context without squinting at the list view.
- Admin config builder: fixed change detection so settings-only updates (e.g., toggling managed MCP injection) persist even when the rendered TOML hash stays the same; the UI now sends the rendered sha256 on save, keeps the blank reasoning-summary option truly blank, and hides the managed `cdx` MCP entry just like other reserved servers.
- MCP streamable HTTP now advertises underscore tool names (`memory_store|memory_retrieve|memory_search`) that satisfy the MCP/OpenAI tool regex (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`); dot aliases remain accepted for calls, and coverage was added to guard the naming rules.
- MCP resource browsing/templates added: `/mcp` now implements `resources/templates/list`, `resources/list`, and `resources/read` for host memories (`memory://{id}` URIs, text/plain), so MCP clients can enumerate or fetch stored notes.
- MCP `memory_store` now accepts a bare string payload in MCP `tools/call` (`arguments: "note text"`), wrapping it as `content` for convenience; still validates full object bodies.
- MCP `memory_search` also accepts a bare string payload and maps it to `query`, so `arguments: "foo"` works alongside the object form.
- Added MCP method aliases `list_tools`/`call_tool` (and dot variants) plus capability flags (`tools.list`/`tools.call`) so clients using either naming scheme are supported.
- Added MCP aliases for resource templates: `list_resource_templates` and `resources.templates.list` now map to `resources/templates/list`.
- Added MCP resource creation (`resources/create`, aliases `resources.create` and `create_resource`) that writes `memory://{id}` URIs to the memory store from text content.
- Added MCP aliases for resource listing: `list_resources` and `resources.list` now map to `resources/list`.
- Added MCP aliases for resource reading: `read_resource` and `resources.read` now map to `resources/read`.
- Added MCP resource update (`resources/update`, aliases `resources.update` and `update_resource`) to overwrite a `memory://{id}` with new text content.
- Added MCP resource delete (`resources/delete`, aliases `resources.delete` and `delete_resource`) which overwrites the memory with empty content to mark deletion; true DB delete can follow later if desired.
- Added MCP tool `fs_read_file` (alias `fs.read_file`) to read text files rooted at the app directory; includes path normalization and outside-root guard.
- Added MCP tool `fs_write_file` (alias `fs.write_file`) to write text files under the app root with create/overwrite flags and path escape protections.
- Added MCP tool `fs_list_dir` (alias `fs.list_dir`) to list directory entries under the app root with optional glob filtering.
- Added MCP tools `fs_file_exists` / `fs_stat` (aliases `fs.file_exists`, `fs.stat`) to check existence and stat paths under the app root with size/mtime/type metadata.
- Added MCP tool `fs_search_in_files` (alias `fs.search_in_files`) to find string matches under a root with optional glob filters and capped results.
- Added MCP memory tools `memory_append` / `memory_query` / `memory_list` (dot aliases supported) for scoped note storage, querying, and listing with per-resource tagging.
- MCP memory tool responses are now returned as MCP `content` blocks (text payload) to satisfy clients expecting CallToolResult.content.
- Added MCP resource tools (`resource_read|create|update|delete|list`, dot aliases) that wrap the resource endpoints and return MCP content blocks.
- `fs_search_in_files` now matches glob filters against filenames and relative paths (e.g., `src/Database.php`).
- MCP reasoning summary now normalizes per model: `gpt-5.1-codex-max` is forced to `detailed`; other models accept `auto|concise|detailed`; invalid/`none` values are stripped.

# 2025-12-06
- Fixed the admin config builder to only emit valid `reasoning.summary` values (`auto|concise|detailed`), drop legacy `none`, and normalize previously stored configs so OpenAI no longer rejects uploads.
- Repaired `ClientConfigService::retrieve` (broken PHP parse, restored baked/base SHA logic + cache) and added coverage for reasoning summary normalization.
- Removed the Model Providers section (we only ship ChatGPT/OpenAI), so builder no longer accepts provider blocks and server drops `model_providers` entries when rendering config.toml.
- Defaults box now only asks for Model + Reasoning Effort + Reasoning Summary; default profile and model provider inputs were removed since we always target ChatGPT.
- Notices are now always hidden (gpt5 migration + rate-limit nags), with the toggles removed from the builder UI.
- Feature toggles now have human-readable labels while keeping their underlying config keys intact.
- Dropped the OTEL environment input from the MCP/Telemetry card; OTEL environment now defaults to blank.
- Managed MCP now uses native HTTP (no npm): baked config injects `[mcp_servers.cdx] url="{base}/mcp" http_headers = { Authorization = "Bearer {host_api_key}" }`, replacing the broken `npx codex-orchestrator-mcp` shim.
- `/config/retrieve` now bakes `config.toml` per host using that host’s API key for the managed MCP entry, returns both `baked sha256` and `base_sha256`, and only ships content when the baked hash changes (host API key rotation forces a refresh); docs/tests updated.
- Added a dedicated admin config builder page (`/admin/config.html`) that captures every known `config.toml` knob (model/provider/profile, approval policy, sandbox, features/notices, shell env policy, model providers/profiles, MCP servers, OTEL, custom blocks) with live server-side rendering + SHA/size preview and one-click deploy to hosts.
- Added an iPhone-style toggle in the config builder to prefill a managed `codex-memory` MCP server pointing at this coordinator (npx command + API base); hosts get it baked automatically unless disabled, with per-host API key injected at config sync time (no key stored server-side).
- Added canonical `config.toml` storage (`client_config_documents` table) with `/config/retrieve` for hosts and `/admin/config` + `/admin/config/render|store` for admins; docs (API/DB/cdx/overview/README) updated accordingly.
- `cdx` now syncs `~/.codex/config.toml` from the server (warns on offline/missing-config, deletes local files when the server reports `missing`); wrapper bumped to 2025.12.06-01.
- Covered the new ClientConfigService with unit tests.
- Rebranded the admin dashboard and logs page titles to “Codex-Coordinator” instead of “Codex-Auth” so the UI matches the product name.
- Added MCP-compatible memory storage for Codex: `/mcp/memories/store|retrieve|search` reuse host API keys, persist notes in MySQL with full-text search over content/tags, and support tagged filtering so Codex MCP clients can sync memories across sessions.
- Added an Admin dashboard Memories panel (filter by host/tags/query, limit results) to browse stored MCP memories without shell access.
- Documented the new memory API (API/DB/cdx source-of-truth docs, README) and covered MemoryService with unit tests.

# 2025-12-05
- Rebuilt the Quota Policy card into an Operations & Settings panel that now hosts the quota toggle, API kill switch, runner trigger, seed auth.json action, and version check instead of scattering those controls across the header; the entire panel is collapsible (hidden by default) to keep the dashboard compact.
- Moved the insecure-host enable window slider into the same Operations & Settings panel, persist the selection locally (2–60 minutes), and pass it along whenever an insecure host is re-enabled.
- Expanded the AGENTS.md editor modal with a wider layout and taller textarea so editing lengthy instructions isn’t cramped.
- Removed the AGENTS.md SHA display from the dashboard meta line to keep that info box focused on update time and size.
- Added a quota limit slider under Quota Policy (50–100%, default 100%) so admins can warn or hard-stop Codex runs before hitting 100% usage; `/admin/quota-mode` now persists both `hard_fail` and `limit_percent`, `/auth` responses include `quota_limit_percent`, and the logs page no longer shows the orphaned API toggle.
- Updated `cdx`/wrapper summary and quota logic to honor the new `quota_limit_percent` threshold (and new env override `CODEX_QUOTA_LIMIT_PERCENT`), raising warnings or blocking launches once the configured percent is used.
- Hosts can now be marked VIP via the dashboard or `/admin/hosts/{id}/vip`; VIP hosts always run in warn-only mode regardless of the global quota setting, carry a “VIP” chip in the UI, and the flag is included in `/auth` responses + docs.
- Fixed the wrapper’s quota summary logic so it no longer uses `local` outside a function (`bin/cdx`/`storage/wrapper/cdx`), preventing the `/usr/local/bin/cdx: line 3629: local: can only be used in a function` error when running on insecure hosts.
- Admins can now pick a 2–60 minute insecure-host window via the dashboard slider; `/admin/hosts/{id}/insecure/enable` accepts `duration_minutes`, the server persists `insecure_window_minutes`, `/auth` extends windows by that duration (default 10), and docs/UI/CHANGELOG were updated accordingly.
- Added canonical AGENTS.md storage on the server with `/agents/retrieve` for hosts and `/admin/agents` (+ dashboard modal) for admins; hosts replace `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` on every sync and delete stale copies when the server copy is cleared.
- Dashboard now shows an AGENTS.md panel with inline preview + edit modal so project instructions can be updated without shell access.
- cdx pulls AGENTS.md alongside slash commands (python required), handles offline/missing-config gracefully, and surfaces sync status in the boot summary; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.05-01.
- Updated source-of-truth docs (API/DB/cdx) and README to reflect server-managed AGENTS.md instead of the old manual sync script.

# 2025-12-04
- Reformatted ChatGPT quota reset labels to read naturally (e.g., “Resets in 5 days (Tuesday)” and richer sub-48h phrasing) instead of the old “5d 13h 54m to reset” timer text.
- Added `scripts/sync-agents.php` to sync the repo’s `AGENTS.md` into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (honors `CODEX_HOME`) so Codex always picks up the latest project instructions with a single command.
- Rebuilt the ChatGPT Estimated Total cost modal with hoverable tooltips, a detailed per-day panel, and a scrolling day-by-day table so you can see exact dates and values instead of guessing from the old coarse chart.
- Added a Slash Commands “New Command” button that opens the creation modal empty, so fresh prompts can be authored without editing an existing entry first.

# 2025-12-02
- Applied the grok.com neon black theme across the admin dashboard + Client Logs views (desktop + mobile) so both screens match the new Grok-branded look-and-feel.
- Rebuilt the Grok theme using the `/root/grok.html` charcoal + teal palette so every dashboard/logs surface (backgrounds, nav, cards, chips, logs, toggles, mobile) now matches grok.com with zero neon gradients left.
- Iterated on the admin styling twice: first with a charcoal/blue corporate pass, then all the way to a light, airy OpenAI-inspired look (white cards, soft shadows, subtle accents) and restored the OpenAI logo in both dashboard + logs headers, keeping desktop/mobile in sync.
- Reshaped the ChatGPT usage summary so the Input/Output/Cached cards mirror the Estimated Total box and now show Today/Week/Month token counts (no more per-card cost rows or USD heading).
- Estimated Total now reports actual ChatGPT costs (using pricing_day/week/month_cost + currency) with Today/Week/Month cost chips instead of duplicating token counts.
- Simplified the Authorized Hosts table headers so the sort controls look like standard clickable text (no chunky buttons) for easier scanning.
- Converted the Authorized Hosts column sorters to plain text links (with keyboard support) so the remaining “button bubble” chrome is gone across browsers.
- Updated table hover highlights to a light orange accent so row selection/hover states match the airy theme instead of the previous dark blue wash.
- Restyled the Authorized Hosts table to stick with the green accent palette (header gradient + green row fills/hover states) so the list feels cohesive with the rest of the admin look.
- Swapped all button hover states (nav + standard + “ghost” controls such as Logs/Seed/New Host) to the green accent gradient so the old blue dip is gone.
- Tweaked the cdx CLI (bin + seeded wrapper) so insecure hosts treat expected auth refreshes as normal: no more “updating auth / auth outdated” noise in the command/result/auth rows, and the auth status tone stays green unless there’s a real problem.
- Added dedicated launcher commands: `cdx shell` now forces `--model gpt-5.1-codex` and `cdx code` forces `--model gpt-5.1-codex-max` before calling Codex, and `cdx --execute "<prompt>"` runs `codex --model gpt-5.1 --sandbox read-only -a untrusted exec --skip-git-repo-check` directly (no wrapper output) while passing through extra arguments, capturing the final reply via `--output-last-message` and printing only that reply; wrapper bumped to 2025.12.02-04.
- Boot summary rows are now deduplicated, sorted, and easier to read while keeping the quota bars untouched.
- Fixed `cdx --execute` so `--skip-git-repo-check` is passed after `exec`, matching Codex CLI expectations.
- Fixed cdx runner telemetry so the status line reflects the fresh verification time immediately after the runner is triggered.
- cdx now shows “auth runner just verified” when the runner completed within ~90 seconds, replacing “<1m ago”; wrapper version bumped to 2025.12.02-01.
- Admin dashboard adds a “Quick: Insecure hosts” menu action (only visible when insecure hosts exist) that opens a scrollable modal listing insecure hosts (FQDN + enable/disable) with active windows pinned to the top.
- Added `GET /admin/hosts/insecure` for a minimal insecure-hosts list suitable for quick UI actions.

# 2025-12-01
- Estimated Total card no longer repeats the month-to-date total in its header, relying on the breakdown chips below.
- cdx now treats `/auth` HTTP 5xx/network outages as offline, keeping cached auth usable and surfacing the offline reason instead of hard failures.
- Slash command sync reports API outages/HTTP 5xx as offline (warn) and the wrapper version is bumped to 2025.12.01-03.
- Token usage ingests now compute and persist per-entry/aggregate costs from configured pricing (with backfill for existing rows) and expose a Cost column + currency on the Client Logs page.
- Auth runner preflight now runs every ~8 hours (first non-admin request per window) instead of once per UTC day, still refreshing the cached GitHub client version; interval configurable via `AUTH_RUNNER_PREFLIGHT_SECONDS` (default 28800s).
- Restyled the ChatGPT month-to-date cost cards with balanced tokens/cost lines and a dedicated total header, replacing the squished four-box layout.
- Estimated Total graph now opens a dedicated 60-day cost trend (input/output/cached) instead of reusing the quota chart placeholder.
- Added a stats icon to the ChatGPT estimated total card to mirror the weekly limit affordance.
- ChatGPT estimated total icon now opens the quota trend chart, matching the weekly limit graph control.
- Authorized Hosts table headers are now clickable to sort (toggle ascending/descending) by host, last seen, client, wrapper, or IP.
- Refreshed the ChatGPT estimated total card with a highlighted primary figure and chips for Today/Week/Month breakdown.
- Admin overview now includes daily token/cost totals for the dashboard, and the ChatGPT cost card shows Today/Week/Month estimates without the previous “includes” blurb.
- Added bash 4.2-safe guard for wrapper release tag selection to prevent `candidate_tags[@]` nounset errors during Codex refresh, and bumped wrapper version to 2025.12.01-02.
- Installer now selects the extracted Codex binary (skipping the tarball) and tolerates empty user lists on bash 4.2 by guarding array expansion in cdx, preventing nounset crashes during install/version checks.
- Fixed installer curl invocation to avoid `curl_flags[@]` unbound variable errors on older bash releases (e.g., CloudLinux 7) when IPv4 forcing is unset.
- Fixed installation UUID bootstrap to reuse existing `.env` values and avoid chmods that broke web-user access, preventing API 500s when env files were unreadable.
- Added installation UUID enforcement (server + baked cdx) to prevent cross-instance mixups; `/auth` rejects mismatched `installation_id`, installers/cdx carry the UUID.
- Added persistent IPv4-only host toggle (admin API + dashboard) that clears IP binding and bakes wrappers/installers with `curl -4`; cdx fetches updates over IPv4 when set.
- Aligned Logs header button styling with other admin controls.
- Installation UUID now auto-generates at boot/migration via shared helper, ensuring `.env` is populated across entrypoints without manual edits.
- Dashboard now shows weekly and month-to-date cost estimates side-by-side (using pricing + token usage) instead of daily totals.
- ChatGPT usage cost card now renders separate lines: “X$ this Week” and “Y$ this Month” for clearer readability.
- Weekly cost now uses the ChatGPT weekly limit window start (when available) instead of a naive trailing 7-day slice for more accurate estimates.
- Backups: the `mysql-backup` sidecar now runs by default, writes to `${DATA_ROOT}/backups`, and replaces the host cron helper; `docker compose up` automatically schedules nightly dumps (tuned via `DB_BACKUP_*` env vars) and setup/docs were updated accordingly.
