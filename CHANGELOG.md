# 2025-12-01
- Added installation UUID enforcement (server + baked cdx) to prevent cross-instance mixups; `/auth` rejects mismatched `installation_id`, installers/cdx carry the UUID.
- Added persistent IPv4-only host toggle (admin API + dashboard) that clears IP binding and bakes wrappers/installers with `curl -4`; cdx fetches updates over IPv4 when set.
