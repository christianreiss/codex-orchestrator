# cdx Wrapper Interface (Source of Truth)

- `cdx` is downloaded per host via `/wrapper/download`; the script is baked with `BASE_URL`, `API_KEY`, `FQDN`, optional CA file, and the host security flag (`secure`, defaults to on). Insecure hosts start with a 30-minute provisioning window so initial sync works immediately; dashboard “Enable” now exposes a 2–60 minute slider (default 10) that re-opens a sliding window for `/auth` calls, and each subsequent `/auth` refresh extends the window by the configured duration. “Disable” closes it immediately (no store grace).
- Source is organized under `bin/cdx.d/*.sh`; run `scripts/build-cdx.sh` to assemble the shipped `bin/cdx`. Edit fragments, not the built file, and bump `WRAPPER_VERSION` whenever `bin/cdx` changes.
- On launch it:
  - Pulls `auth.json` from `/auth` (store/retrieve). If the API is unreachable or returns HTTP 5xx it proceeds with cached auth when `last_refresh` is ≤24h old (or ≤7 days for secure hosts, with a warning) and surfaces the offline reason. It refuses to start when the API key is invalid, the insecure window is closed, the API kill-switch is on, or no recent auth is available.
  - Reports the current user + hostname to `/host/users` (API key + IP binding) and receives the known user list for the host; `--uninstall` removes `~/.codex` for those users (fallback: current user only if the API call fails).
  - Honors the server-side ChatGPT quota policy (`quota_hard_fail` plus `quota_limit_percent`); admins can flip to warn-only or lower the kill threshold in the dashboard (or set `CODEX_QUOTA_HARD_FAIL=0` / `CODEX_QUOTA_LIMIT_PERCENT=<percent>` before running `cdx`).
  - Surfaces runner telemetry from `/auth` versions (`runner_enabled`, `runner_state`, `runner_last_ok`/`runner_last_fail`/`runner_last_check`) with stale/failure warnings.
  - Shows host usage returned by `/auth` (`api_calls` and current-month token totals including cached/reasoning) in the boot summary.
- TLS: respects baked CA; as a last resort `CODEX_SYNC_ALLOW_INSECURE=1` permits unverified HTTPS for sync/prompt calls (not recommended).
- Synchronizes slash command prompts in `~/.codex/prompts` against `/slash-commands` (lists + per-file retrieve on hash mismatch) and records a baseline; on exit it pushes any changed/new prompts back via `/slash-commands/store`. Server-retired prompts are removed locally.
  - Slash command sync treats API outages/HTTP 5xx as offline (warn) instead of a hard failure; prompt push still runs when possible.
  - AGENTS.md is pulled from `/agents/retrieve` on every run and written to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (directory created if missing). The file is **never** pushed upstream; if the server reports `status:missing`, the local AGENTS.md is deleted to avoid stale instructions. Python is required for sync; missing config or offline servers are reported but do not block auth.
  - Autodetects/installs `curl`/`unzip`, updates Codex CLI/binary, and self-updates the wrapper.
  - Parses **all** Codex stdout lines like `Token usage: total=… input=… (+ … cached) output=… (reasoning …)` and POSTs them to `/usage` (as an array) with the host API key; if a line cannot be parsed into numbers, it is still sent as raw `line`. The server calculates and stores per-entry/aggregate costs from pricing (env fallbacks `GPT51_*`/`PRICING_CURRENCY`).
  - When `/auth` returns a `chatgpt_usage` block, surfaces 5-hour and weekly ChatGPT quota bars during boot (with reset ETA) for operator visibility.
  - After Codex runs, pushes updated auth if changed and sends token-usage metrics. When the host is marked **insecure** (API `host.secure=false` or baked flag), `cdx` purges `~/.codex/auth.json` after the push so credentials are not left on disk and emits an extra bootstrap warning to flag the ephemeral state.
- `cdx --uninstall` removes Codex binaries/config, legacy env/auth files, npm `codex-cli`, and calls `DELETE /auth`.
- `cdx --update` forces a wrapper refresh from the server (via `/wrapper/download`) even when versions match, then exits after the update attempt.
- `cdx shell [args...]` automatically prepends `--model gpt-5.1-codex` before launching Codex, while `cdx code [args...]` forces `--model gpt-5.1-codex-max`; both commands must be the first argument and can be combined with other Codex flags afterward.
- `cdx --execute "<prompt>" [args...]` skips all wrapper logging, runs `codex --model gpt-5.1 --sandbox read-only -a untrusted exec --skip-git-repo-check "<prompt>" ...`, captures the final assistant reply via `--output-last-message`, and prints only that reply (no CLI banners/logs); no other wrapper flags may accompany this mode.
- The API can return HTTP 429 when IP rate limits trip (global bucket or repeated invalid API keys). Responses include `bucket`, `limit`, and `reset_at`; callers should back off until `reset_at` before retrying.
- Wrapper publishing: the bundled `bin/cdx` in the Docker image is the source of truth. Rebuilds seed storage automatically; there is no `/wrapper` upload endpoint. Any change to `bin/cdx` must bump `WRAPPER_VERSION`.
